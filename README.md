Code for MAP (Mentored Advanced Project) Research 

This research was conducted from July 2023-December 2023 at the Grinnell College Statistics Department. It was advised by Jonathan Wells and Ryan Miller. The paper for which this code was created is still a work in progress and can be found in this repo.
